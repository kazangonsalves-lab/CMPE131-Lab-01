Through branching, multiple developers can develop different programs of one project without affecting others.
The added flexibility to add different features separately allows different developers to each develop
different programs without the need to be involved with the development of others. In addition, merging from local to 
a project holder such as github removes dependence on the server and the internet to access and work on programs.
When an internet outage happens, the code will not be inaccessible since the computer still locally has the program.
The result in the end allows large systems to add features separately when they are ready to be tested and released
